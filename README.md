As a frequent diner, you love trying out new restaurants and experimenting with different foods. However, having to figure out what you want to order can be a time-consuming ordeal if the menu is big, and you want an easier way to be able to figure out what you are going to eat.
<br>
In this project, you’ll use JavaScript to randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu. We’ll keep running it until we’re satisfied with the generated meal!
